# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The problems are organized by difficulty level, and each solution includes a corresponding test case to ensure correctness. The project is structured in a way that allows easy navigation between the different problem categories and test cases.

### 1. Running Solutions
Each solution is written in Java. You can navigate to the appropriate difficulty folder (e.g., `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`) and run the Java files directly.

Example:
```bash
cd easy
javac Problem1.java
java Problem1
```

### 2. Running Tests
Tests are located in the test/ directory. Each test file corresponds to a solution file. You can run the tests using a testing framework like JUnit.
